                    <h5 class="pos-text">Explore the exquisite rolling hills and spectacular scenery from the seat of a power-assisted eBike. eBikes are fun, easy to use and brilliant for people who prefer a power boost up the hills. With that helping hand when you need it, you can whoosh up the hills with minimum effort and enjoy the views from the top.
                        We're excited to offer dedicated eBike tours in beautiful Tuscany. These cycling holidays are fully guided with the option to self-guide if you prefer. We also have a great range of eBike tours in France and Sussex and the Cotswolds in the UK                    
                        Although we have specific tours designed for eBikes, all of our tours have an eBike option, so if you fancy expending more energy sightseeing and enjoying the local cuisine, speak to one of our experts about using an eBike instead.</h5>
